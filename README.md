## Task 1: Even or Odd Checker
This program takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement. It also includes error handling for invalid inputs.

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
This program uses a for loop to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 50 and displays the final result.

## Concepts Used
- if-else statements
- for loops
- range() function
- Exception handling (try-except)

## Output
Task 1: Displays whether a number is even or odd.
Task 2: Displays the total sum (1275).
